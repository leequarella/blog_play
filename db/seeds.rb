# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
   post1 = BlogPost.create([{ title: 'Title 1' }, { author: 'Author 1' },{ article: 'This is an example post' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
